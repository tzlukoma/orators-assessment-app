# orators-app

App for Orators Organization

This is an app to help the orators organization manage assessments and assignments for orators.

## Technology Used

- React
- Redux
- Firebase

# Background

I wrote this application as a pilot for the NJ Orators organization to help them track assessments for their students. The app was never used in production, so I am no longer building new features, but I figured some of the code here may help somebody.

# Set Up

Pre-Requisite

- Firebase account (works on the Free tier)

To get the app to run, you will need to replace the values in the .env files with your own Firebase details.

Then run

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

To use the deploy scripts, you will need the firebase cli which you can read about [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
